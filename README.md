About Uno:
Uno is the highly popular card game played by millions around the world. This game is played by matching and then discarding the cards in your hand until there are none left.

The objective:
The goal of UNO is to be the first person to play the last card in your hand. The fun of UNO is the requirement to shout "UNO!" when you are down to the last card.

Game Setup: 
The game is for 2-10 players, each player starts with seven cards, you must match by number, color or symbol/action. For example, if the last card played is a red card that is an 8, you must place a red card or a card with an 8 on it. You can also play a wild card (which can change the current color in play).
If the player has no matches or chooses not to play any of his cards, even though he may have a match, he must buy a card from the purchase pile. If that card is playable, play it. Otherwise, keep the card and the game moves on to the next person.
Play continues until a player has a card left. The moment a player has only one card left, they must shout "UNO!". If they are caught not saying "Uno" by another player before the next player has their turn, that player must buy two new cards as a penalty. Assuming the player is unable to play/discard their last card and needs to buy, but after drawing, is able to play/discard that penultimate card, the player must repeat the action of shouting "Uno". 
Once a player has no more cards, the game round ends.

Special Cards: 
SKIP - Blocks the next player.
Reverse - If clockwise, change to counterclockwise or vice versa.
+2 - When one person draws this card, the next player must pick up two cards.
